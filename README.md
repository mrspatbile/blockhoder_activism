# blockhoder_activism
This repo contains code for my research in Blockholder Activism. Data is sourced from SEC EDGAR and WRDS/CRSP APIs. 

To configure the code for your private environment, follow these steps:

1. Edit the EDGAR Request Header:
Modify the "User-Agent" in the header to "Your Name (your.email@example.com)" for accessing EDGAR data.

2. Access WRDS:
Zou must have a valid account with the necessary permissions, typically available through research institutions. You will be prompted to input your username and password when running the code.
